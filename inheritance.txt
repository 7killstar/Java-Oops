Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

types of Inheritance
1.Singel Inheritance
2.Multiple Inheritance(java never occur this inheritance)
3.Multilevel Inhritance
4.Herarical Inhritance
5.Hybrid Inheritance


Advantages:-
>Inheritance promotes reusability. When a class inherits or derives another class, it can access all the functionality of inherited class.
>Reusability enhanced reliability. The base class code will be already tested and debugged.
>As the existing code is reused, it leads to less development and maintenance costs.
>Inheritance makes the sub classes follow a standard interface.
>Inheritance helps to reduce code redundancy and supports code extensibility.
>Inheritance facilitates creation of class libraries.

one of the example:-

class Teacher {
   String designation = "Teacher";
   String collegeName = "Beginnersbook";
   void does(){
	System.out.println("Teaching");
   }
}

public class PhysicsTeacher extends Teacher{
   String mainSubject = "Physics";
   public static void main(String args[]){
	PhysicsTeacher obj = new PhysicsTeacher();
	System.out.println(obj.collegeName);
	System.out.println(obj.designation);
	System.out.println(obj.mainSubject);
	obj.does();
   }
}
Output:

Beginnersbook
Teacher
Physics
Teaching
