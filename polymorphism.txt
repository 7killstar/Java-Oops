>Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.Like:-Overloding,Overriding.
Advantage:- 
• It helps programmers to reuse the code, classes, methods written once, tested and implemented. They may be reused in many ways.

• The single variable name can be used to store variables of multiple data types such as Int, Float, double, Long, etc).

• Polymorphism helps in reducing the coupling between different functionalities.

Disadvantage:-
>Run time polymorphism makes performance issue 


code:-
class Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating bread...");}  
}  
class Cat extends Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating rat...");}  
}  
class Lion extends Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating meat...");}  
}  
class TestPolymorphism3{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
Animal a;  
a=new Dog();  
a.eat();  
a=new Cat();  
a.eat();  
a=new Lion();  
a.eat();  
}}  


OutPut:-

eating bread...
eating rat...
eating meat...
